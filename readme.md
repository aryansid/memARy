Limitations: 
1. Input speech (audio files) of upto 25 mb can be used for now. Can expand but would need to add more functionality. 

Other considerations: 
1. Add exponential backoff to GPT call
2. Token length for gpt4 vision
3. Do not want to keep overwriting audio files. You may want to delete them at the end.
